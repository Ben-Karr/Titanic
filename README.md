Notebooks for the kaggle Titanic competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
Solved with the fast.ai TabularLearner and also (for comparison) with XGBoost.
The XGBoost was not finetuned at all, but the results from the neural networ are also pretty satisfying...

__Rank__: 542 (as of May2020); __Top 2.8%__

To improve this even more:
* Fine tune the GradientBoost learner or
* ensemble both results.

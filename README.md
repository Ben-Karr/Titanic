Notebooks for the kaggle Titanic competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
Solved with the fast.ai TabularLearner and also (for comparison) with XGBoost.
The XGBoost was not finetuned at all, but the results from the neural networ are also pretty satisfying...

To improve this even more: 
* Fine tune the GradientBoost learner or 
* ensemble both results.
